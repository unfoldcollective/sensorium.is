This machine-like sculpture is slowly generating a continuous series of cloud forms, offering a comparison between a metallic structure and an artificial reproduction of a natural phenomenon. This supposed contrast between technology and nature is explored in a scope of unseen possibilities of sustainable interdependence. The formation of the clouds is programmed to conceal an algorithmic poem, coded into the winds, and the air is used as an ephemeral storage medium. Lukas Truniger developed this piece in collaboration with architect Itamar Bergfreund and research scientist Bruce Yoder. It was awarded with a Burning Man 2018 Honoraria art grant. The installation will be part of the performances situated in the site specific nature location.

Lukas Truniger is a Swiss media artist and electronic musician who engages in the world of multimedia installations, performances and creation of new musical instruments. [Read more.](http://sensorium.is/speakers/lukas-truniger)
