Danica finds herself in-between textile and architecture, soft and hard, ephemeral and perpetual. She studied architecture at Academy of Fine Arts and Design (AFAD) in Bratislava, where she developed her interest in problems relating to the body, soft architecture and the relationship between clothing and space. She continued with her doctoral research within this field, while in 2016 she was part of [CITA](https://kadk.dk/en/CITA) (Center for Information Technology and Architecture in Copenhagen), where she enriched her research with digital approaches. 

Currently, she works as part of Woven architecture studio and as a teaching assistant at AFAD, exhibits her work in Slovakia and abroad and continues with her research by prototyping objects and publishing her studies and texts.
