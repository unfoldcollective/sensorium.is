**Dead Janitor**

A movie director who shall not be named once said he'd rather shoot film about man walking his dog than make a film about a Chinese emperor. Dead Janitor's prolific body of work seems like a sonic extract of this idea. There's no spectacular narratives, no massive synth blasts, instead the his latest output sees the producers focus turn towards crispy sonic micro worlds full of vibrant textures and dystopian atmospheres which carry momentum peppered with electric detail.

**FVLCRVM**

…was meant to be an innocent side project by a member of well established Slovak math-pop band NVMERI. But it got completely out of control after releasing the frst EP and remixes which got him instant recognition by big dogs from the clubbing scene. Only a few weeks after release he was chosen to participate on Red Bull Bass Camp Bratislava and Prague. No wonder he became quickly a confdent choice of Central European promoters as a side-act for artists like Hudson Mohawke, Just Blaze, Pomo, Tokimonsta, Falty DL and others.

His sound is a mixture of internet movements emerging from LA, New Jersey and Tokyo in latest years like Jersey Club, Footwork, Future Beats, Grime and genres with having no distinct name yet. But the strong emphasis on boomy beats and organic melodic compositions comes from his early years of being a tireless musician playing gospel music around Europe with a church band where he grew up.
