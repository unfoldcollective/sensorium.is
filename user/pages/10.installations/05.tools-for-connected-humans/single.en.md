Nowadays, smartphones are seen as an extension of the human being. Both a tool and a distraction, these devices make it difficult to focus due to a digital overload of social interactions. The ability to interact with others without a connected devices is fading away. 

As an interaction designer, the artist questions our actual relationship with technology face its utterly promises to shape a better world. 

In the search for space for more disconnected interactions, he designed Tools for Connected Humans. A series of connected devices ready to help the user disconnect from connectivity.
