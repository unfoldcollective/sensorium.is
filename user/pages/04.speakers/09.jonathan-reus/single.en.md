Jonathan Reus is a Dutch-American sound artist and art-technology researcher working through expanded forms of musicmaking, instrumentations, tools and mathematical representations as artistic forms. His practice is cross-disciplinary and research-based, involving open and iterative processes of collaboration with researchers from across the arts, sciences and humanities. His work is generally inspired by a fascination with the immanent poetics of mathematical-logistical structures, and an interest in lived practices that confront the representational capacities of these structures.

Jonathan is a co-founder of the [Instrument Inventors Initiative](https://instrumentinventors.org)and of the Platform for Thought in Motion in the Hague. He has curated programs at [STEIM](http://steim.org/) (Amsterdam) and [Transmediale Festival](https://transmediale.de/) (Berlin), and since 2015 has co-curated The Reading Room series at Stroom Den Haag. Jonathan co-developed the Digital Media bachelors at the Institute for Culture and Aesthetics of Digital Media at Leuphana University, for which he was awarded the teaching prize for cross-disciplinary work across art and the humanities.
