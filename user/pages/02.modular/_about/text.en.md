Sensorium is a festival joining a conference, workshops, exhibitions and performances bridging the fields of art, technology and science. Founded in 2016 it has brought to Bratislava the most cutting edge artists, designers and innovators from all around the world. Today we grew into a curious interdisciplinary community, looking forward to reuniting in the gardens of Pistori Palace in Bratislava.

The festival collaborates on its programme with many international organisations such as [Future Everything](http://futureeverything.org/) in the UK, [School of Machines](http://www.schoolofma.org) in Germany, [Instrument Inventors Initiative](https://instrumentinventors.org) in the Netherlands, [Choreographic Coding Labs](http://choreographiccoding.org), [HOLO magazine](http://holo-magazine.com) and many more.
