For four days, the [Augmented Attention Lab](/lab) will bring together a wide range of participants to explore technologies and practices that focus our attention towards sensing varied intensities of change within our environment. We invite makers to collaboratively build new wearable / portable tools and develop sensory practices that augment the body in order to sense environmental changes, occuring at the threshold of the human sensory spectrum.
