For this 5th edition (12 - 14 June 2020 in Bratislava, Slovakia), we have a special focus on creating a space that brings innovation, arts, creative industries and experimental technology to all types of audiences from the hands of research groups, startups, artists, makers and entrepreneurs.

The Educational Space aims to become a place of encounter for those involved in the future of education: research labs, groups and projects that work at the intersection of **arts, innovation, technology and creative industries** from all countries of Europe and other continents. 

The Educational Space is addressed to creative minds that experiment with technology as a tool from interdisciplinary methods, committed to **shape the future developing innovative and creative tools** from an educational perspective: from engineers, scientists, artists, programmers, biologists, educators to global platforms, etc.

Through our Educational Space you can connect and engage with a wide audience from different professional spheres, promote your project, test your prototype, find out other related initiatives and introduce your product to potential research partners and investors.

* **Showcase** your work to a wide European and international audience
